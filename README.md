# Base-NFT-Forwarder
This repository contains the smart contract and documentation for a Badge Forwarder deployed on the Base network. This unique contract instantly performs two automated actions upon receiving a minimum deposit from a user: it mints an ERC-721 badge as proof of participation and forwards the deposited funds directly to the owner's wallet.
