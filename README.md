# üöÄ Base NFT Forwarder

This repository contains the smart contract and documentation for a **Badge Forwarder** deployed on the Base network. This unique contract is designed to be fully autonomous: it instantly **mints an ERC-721 badge** as proof of participation and **forwards the deposited funds** directly to the owner's wallet upon receiving a minimum deposit.

## üí° User Interaction Guide (Click-Only Deposit)

The user interaction requires only a standard ETH transfer, making it simple and automated. The contract's `receive()` function handles both the minting and forwarding processes simultaneously.

### User Steps to Get a Badge

1.  **Open Wallet:** Open any wallet connected to the Base network (e.g., MetaMask).
2.  **Recipient:** Paste the **Contract Address** into the recipient field.
3.  **Amount:** Input an amount of Base ETH that is **$0.000001$ ETH or higher**.
    * *Note: Sending less than this amount will cause the transaction to fail.*
4.  **Confirm:** Confirm the transaction and pay the gas fee.

### Automated Results on BaseScan

Upon successful transaction confirmation, BaseScan will show two key outcomes:

1.  **NFT Minted:** The transaction's **Events Log** will show a `Transfer` event, confirming that a new **User Participation Badge** NFT has been minted to the user's wallet.
2.  **Funds Forwarded:** An **Internal Transaction** log will show the deposited amount instantly moving from the **Contract Address** to the **Owner Address**.
